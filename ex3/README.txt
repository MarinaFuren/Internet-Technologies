1.What was hard in this ex? 
To start the ex was very hard, to understand what exactly we need to implement, and we fell that we don't know very good the syntax of JavaScript so we 
took a  while and a few tries until we understood how to write the things correctly. We felt that was a big jump in this ex from writing basic code in 
JavaScript to use a lot of JavaScript abilities, we also felt that we spent a lot of time to read the toutrials and we still didn't feel like that we 
understood what we need to implement we also felt that it was unfocused and that a few things were missing like how the http request/respoms looks like.

2.What was fun in this ex?
Was fun to work together:)
We felt that everybode understood that this ex is hard so a lot of people help each other.

3.how did you test your server and include as details result as much as possible
We first did the requested tests, and then we tried to expend the tests to more complicated cases like using params, query and cookies.
